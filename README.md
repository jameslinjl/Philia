### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This is Philia! The app that brings people together to do things
in person rather than stay on their electronic devices all day.
We have built out a demo of our product thus far using Ionic,
Angular, and Firebase, and will be continuing to work on this
project over the next few months.

### Additional Notes:

As of right now, we only have the browser version fully functioning.
The iOS version is not fully built out (auth specifically) and we
will be working to get it up and running as soon as possible.
As exam season got very busy, we weren't able to fully build out
group administration and adding groups, so this is functionality we
will look to continue building out. However, at the moment, you can
experience what a typical user will go through by cloning this repo.

To go through this demo:

Make sure you have ionic installed. You can install this using npm:

npm install -g ionic

Once you have this installed, run:

ionic serve

And this will launch the app in your browser.

To Lev: we learned a ton from this project, but also hit lots of
obstacles as we worked with different languages. This definitely
won't be the end of this project. Danny and I (James) in particular
want to continue building this out, and potentially look to React
Native to replace Ionic as the view. Thank you so much for this
opportunity and we would still be up for meeting up sometime this
summer. Danny and I will be living in Brooklyn this summer, so hit
us up!
